## Useful Commands
### terminal (mac)
```
!! ... rewrite, appending previous command onto your new command.
!$ ... rewrite, appending last argument of previous command to new command.
cd - ... did you accidently `cd /` use cd - to quickly get back to your last cd.
```
### Emacs (mac terminal)
Have fun messing with these in a mac terminal! ðŸ™‚
terminal commands like "ctrl a" and "ctrl e" (a subset of emac commands) also work in other applications 
like slack or google chrome. this is different from vim. 

`ctrl A` beginning of line
<br>`ctrl E` end of line
<br>`ctrl -` undo
<br><b>I probably wont use...</b> `ctrl k` kill remainder of the line.
<br>`ctrl w` remove word backward.


`optn b` backward word. (same note as below)
<br>`optn f` forward word. 
* <b>note, the above two commands require option enabled as metacharacter. contact mike or look at this post. <br>and search chris page: [enable_option_as_meta_and_move_forward_word_emacs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/81272/is-there-any-way-in-the-os-x-terminal-to-move-the-cursor-word-by-word) </b>

`ctrl a` + `ctrl k` could be a lethal combination!
### Vim!! (Im always using vi just because it is one character less to type for program start)
